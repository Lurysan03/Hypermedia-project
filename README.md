## Information Architecture

The information architecture of this website is designed to prioritize clarity, ease of access, and visual appeal. The layout is divided into two main columns: a left column for personal and contact information, and a right column for educational and professional details. This division allows users to quickly distinguish between personal data and career-related content.

1. **Left Column:**
   - **Personal Information**: Provides essential contact details and background information in a concise format, which includes the address, phone, email, and date of birth. This section is positioned at the start to make it easy for potential employers or collaborators to reach out.
   - **Technical Skills and Languages**: Directly follows the personal information, detailing Luis' technical abilities and language proficiency, making it immediately clear what his core competencies are.
   - **Social Media Links**: Placed at the bottom of the left column, this section offers quick access to Luis' professional social media profiles.

2. **Right Column:**
   - **Profile and Academic Background**: These sections are positioned to provide context and validation to the user’s technical skills. The user can quickly see his qualifications and academic history.
   - **Work Experience and Certifications**: Situated under the academic background, these sections provide practical details about his career progress, showcasing real-world experience and additional skills that support his qualifications.
   
This structure ensures that visitors can easily navigate between personal, professional, and social content, creating a balanced flow of information.

## Visual Design

The visual design of the website was carefully crafted to balance professionalism with creativity, ensuring it aligns with the user’s goals and expertise. Several key decisions were made:

1. **Color Scheme**:  
   The website employs a primary color scheme of blue (`#2a3b8f`) for the background of the left column and orange accents (`#ff6f61`) for interactive elements like links and hover states. The blue reflects trustworthiness and professionalism, while the orange highlights important interactive elements, adding a vibrant contrast that attracts attention without overwhelming the user.

2. **Typography**:  
   The use of the **Arial** font ensures readability, maintaining a clean and simple appearance across different devices. The large **h1** and **h2** headers draw attention to the most important sections, while the body text uses a legible font size for easy reading.

3. **Layout and Spacing**:  
   The layout is structured using a two-column design, which allows for a clear visual separation of content. The left column is visually distinct with a dark background, ensuring it stands out and grabs attention. The right column, being lighter, complements the left and ensures the overall design feels balanced. There’s ample padding and spacing between sections to avoid clutter, allowing the user to focus on each piece of information individually.

4. **Interactive Elements**:  
   The hover effects on links and titles provide subtle feedback to users, enhancing their experience by offering interactive cues. For example, when hovering over a section title, an orange underline appears, visually reinforcing interactivity.

These decisions come together to create a modern, professional, and visually engaging online resume, enhancing the user experience and reflecting Luis’ personal brand in the tech and creative industries.
